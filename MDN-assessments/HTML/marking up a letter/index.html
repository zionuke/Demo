        <h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>

        <p>Dear Eileen,</p>
        <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part<br>
         of your <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">PhD</abbr> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>
        
        <h2>Starting dates</h2>

        <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you<br> 
            could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>First semester: <em><time datetime="2016-09-09">9 September 2016</time></em></li>
                <li>Second semester: <em><time datetime="2017-01-15">15 January 2017</time></em></li>
                <li>Third semester: <em><time datetime="2017-05-02">2 May 2017</time></em></li>
            </ul>

        <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>

        <p>You can find more information about <a href="http://example.com" title="table of awesome university important dates">important university dates</a> on our website.</p>
                                                                            <!-- 这里title自己做的时候没加-->
        <h2>Subjects of study</h2>

        <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall<br> 
            somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just<br> 
            the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued<br> 
            by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)</li>
            <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the<br> 
                audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 × 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
            <li><abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the<br> 
            research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>

        <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
                                                                    <!--可以试着强调一下时态-->
        <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <em>did</em> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,<br> 
            my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>

        <dl>
            <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
            <dd>A little known but <em>very</em> influential dance dating back as far as 300<abbr title="Before Christ">BC</abbr>, a whole village would dance around<br>
                in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</dd>
            <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
            <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which<br> 
                involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly<br> 
                tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired<br> 
                modern styles such as Twerking.</dd>
            <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
            <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have<br> 
                discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants<br> 
                of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this<br> 
                because they were really cold.</dd> 
        </dl>
